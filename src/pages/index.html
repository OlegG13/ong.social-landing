                        What's changed is the volume and nature of the data being mined from the Internet and our mobile devices, and the growth of a multibillion dollar industry that operates in the shadows with virtually no oversight. Aside from web scraping, devices use microphones and camerasto record ongoing conversations without the user’s knowledge and provide recording access to 3rd party developers for improvement and profit. In other words "you are the product.”

WizeBit seeks to disrupt this unseen industry by launching the first decentralized in-home assistant. It's our mission to ensure your data and privacy is protected and secure. What happens in your home should remain in your home.
